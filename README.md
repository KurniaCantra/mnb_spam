# MNB Spam Classifier

This is a Streamlit app that uses a Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB) model to detect spam messages.

## Dataset

The model was trained on the [SMS Spam Collection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset).

Note: The dataset is somewhat old, so the modelâ€™s accuracy may not fully reflect current spam trends.
